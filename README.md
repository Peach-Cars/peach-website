# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

### Ruby Version

- **3.3.0**

### Rails Version

- **7.2.0**

### System Dependencies

- **PostgreSQL**
- **Redis**
- **Node.js** and **Yarn**

## Setup Instructions

1. Install Ruby dependencies:

   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

2. Install JS dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

## Database Setup

- Create you env fible and replace values with your own

```bash
cp .env-example .env
```

- Create your databases and run migrations

```bash
bin/rails db:create 
bin/rails db:migrate
```

### Legacy local db setup

- Download the legacy db dump [here](https://www.notion.so/peach-technology/Technical-Discovery-Documents-1150aac4e9344594af2de3eeec459123?p=9cd75f5063eb40c58d56e70207228e9a&pm=s) and save it at the root of your project directory

- After the getting the dump, dump the database into your local database

```
psql -U <your_db_user> -d peach -h localhost -f /path/to/your/project/db_backup.sql
```

## Migrations after setup

- To ensure there are no unexpected changes on primary or legacy databases, ensure you specify which db you want to migrate ie

```bash
bin/rails db:create:primary #To re-create primary database 
bin/rails db:create:legacy  #To re-create legacy database 
bin/rails db:migrate:primary #To run primary migrations
bin/rails db:migrate:legacy # To run legacy migrations
```

Itâ€™s a good practice to back up your databases before running migrations to avoid data loss.

### How to Run the Test Suite

### Services
